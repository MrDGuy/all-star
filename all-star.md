# All Star

## All Star @unplugged
Write a program that gets three variables from the user: their points per game, their rebounds per game, and their assists per game, in that order.
We need to figure out if the user is an all star. They are an all star if they got at least 25 points per game. 
Alternatively, they are an all star if they got at least 10 points, at least 10 rebounds, and at least 10 assists. You will need to use both logical and comparison operators here.
You should prints the results of whether they are an all-star in an ``||logic:if else||`` and with  ``||adventure:add text to textlog||``.
